# Itempotent Local Music Library

Over the past years I have been listening to music on many online services such as Spotify, YouTube and SoundCloud. They all have their pros and cons but I have relized the way to go forward is through MP3 files, let me explain why.

## Spotify

| Pros                                     | Cons                       |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| * Mainstream music                       | * Little underground music |
| * Control playback from multiple devices | * Strict copyright rules   |
| * Collaberative Playlists                |                            |
| * Good metadata                          |                            |

![Example of a song taken off Spotify](/dev/music/unavailable-spotify.png)

This is an example of a song in my playlist that was taken off the platform. This is my main gripe with Spotify and the final straw came when they removed all of [kloudbug](https://soundcloud.com/kloudbug)'s songs.

## YouTube and SoundSloud

I am putting these in the same boat because they allow for anyone to upload music (or at least it is a lot easier than doing it on Spotify).

| Pros                | Cons                               |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| * Underground music | * Music is 2nd to video on YouTube |
|                     | * Usually full length albums/mixes |
|                     | * Bad metadata                     |

There are many songs on SoundCloud and YouTube that are part of full length mixes and if you want to play a specific song you need to know the timestamp.

![Soundcloud Mix](/dev/music/vol-5-sc.png)

Here is the same mix but on Spotify, each track is seperated which allows you to put individual songs in playlists or share them with others.

## MP3s and WAVs

Over the past month I have been *legally* downloading MP3 and WAV files and directly transfering them to my cell phone. This allows for an offline library of thousands of songs that you have complete control over.

This is the same album put in the form of MP3s loaded into [EMMS](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EMMS):

But if you're a boomer then you can use something like Apple's music app for playing local audio files.

The great thing about having these files, rather than renting the ablity to stream them, is that you can back them up on a hard drive, sync them with your phone, burn them to a CD.

## The Problem

The problem comes with managing these files, and the files metadata. As of now I have been manually splitting MP3 and adding all the metadata.

I have been thinking about ways to automate this task and in the process, I think I have come up with a way of allowing people to share songs and playlists.

## My Idea

Using code to describe your music library.

### Side Effects

- Version Control
- Share code with others
- Online repositories of music

### Single Example


This is what [Menthalo's Don't Play With The Gang](https://soundcloud.com/menthalo666/dont-play-with-the-gang) looks like:
